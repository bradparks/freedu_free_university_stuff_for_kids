# freedu

A website for keeping track of what products and services college students get for free (and discounted). It also allows users to submit new services to the database.

Its a [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) UI with a responsive search (and that's basically the only actual feature...what more could you want?!?!)

It will (hopefully) be a totally static site that issues pull requests (via bot account) to a JSON object on Github that holds the website data.

### To do
- Figure out how to issue an xhr pull request
- Publicize this joint
- *house-of-cards* my way into taking hold of the [freedu organization](https://github.com/freedu) name on Github (they aren't even using it!!!)
